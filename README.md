**Overview :** 
A Simple Calculator project in Java is a beginner-level program that typically allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's an overview of how the project can be structured:

**1. Project Purpose:**
The main objective is to create a functional calculator using Java that can perform basic mathematical operations based on user input. It helps in understanding the fundamentals of Java, such as handling user input, using control structures (like if-else or switch), and implementing methods.

**2. Key Features:**
User Interface: A console-based user interface where users can input numbers and select operations.
Operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Error Handling: Catching potential errors, such as dividing by zero or entering invalid inputs.

**3. Project Components:**
Class Structure:
A Calculator class that handles all operations.
Methods for each operation (e.g., add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()).
Control Flow:
Use of if-else or switch-case statements to decide which operation to perform.
Input Handling:
Using Scanner to get user inputs.
Data validation to ensure valid numbers and operations.
